    "OpenMS alignment algorithm performed best in the CAAP study. Originally, the authors of this study evaluated the OpenMS version 1.0. Its alignment algorithm was reimplemented in 2012 and the previous version is no longer bundled with the OpenMS package. We reproduced the evaluation of the CAAP study on the current version of OpenMS. Unfortunately, the current alignment algorithm is achieving significantly worse results despite strenuous attempts to adjust the algorithm parameters to the data. Its alignment precision and recall are on average 60 percentage points lower than the results reported in the CAAP study.\n",
    "\n",
    "The majority of alignment algorithms are not compared with any tool [2]. This results in difficulties in broad comparing Alignstein with the majority of algorithms. Thus, there is a constant need for dedicated LC-MS alignment assessment of currently being state-of-the-art alignment software that not only complements CAAP with other datasets but also selects the best currently available alignment algorithm.\n",
    "To the best of the authors’ knowledge, CAAP is the only assessment of LC-MS alignment algorithms done on real datasets and thus it is widely used for validation.\n",
    "The limited availability of benchmark datasets may result in a growing tendency to analyze algorithms only on data from CAAP work and, therefore, to overfit to this dataset."
